Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to nmail (referred to here as "the application"), a terminal-based email client focused on simplicity and performance. It does not collect, share, or sell any personal data. There is no built-in analytics, telemetry, or advertising of any kind.

The application communicates only with the email servers you configure, using standard IMAP and SMTP protocols to send and receive messages. It never contacts third-party services or performs any background network activity beyond what you explicitly request. The application supports one account per session, helping prevent inadvertent data sharing between accounts.

All cached email data is stored locally on your system, optionally encrypted with AES-256. Nothing is transmitted elsewhere unless it's part of sending or receiving mail through your chosen email servers. Your privacy is a core principle of the application's design.
